# Work Planner

This is a general work planner built in Google Sheets.

![planner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronabf/sheet-planner/master/preview.png)

Included are three scripts:
 * colorRow: formats the background and text style of the entire sheet; runs on edit and on open
 * sort: sorts the sheet by time and course; runs on button trigger
 * createSheet: takes any size sheet and formats it into the work planner styled sheet; runs manually through script editor when needed

A public version of the planner can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14HAGYY7y4bk4GIw061x_fn2V26LHOyFemlNglxK7p_g/edit?usp=sharing).
