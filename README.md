This is a general work planner built in Google Sheets.

Included are two scripts: one formats the document and the other sorts the document. The formatting is done on edit and on open; the sorting is run on button press.

A public version of the planner can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14HAGYY7y4bk4GIw061x_fn2V26LHOyFemlNglxK7p_g/edit?usp=sharing).
